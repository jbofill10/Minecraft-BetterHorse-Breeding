# Better Horse Breeding 1.12

Vanilla horse breeding in Minecraft is very stale because you can never improve the stats of the horses which you currently own.  
 
I've always noticed this, and was very disappointed by that fact.  
 
This forge mod will allow players to breed horses and increase their stats, given that the requirements of the breeding ground and horses are met.
